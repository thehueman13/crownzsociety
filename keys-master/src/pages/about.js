    "We are living in a #ParadigmShift within the subconscious and conscious mind",
    "yet there is a difference in our levels of awareness -- which means there is a difference in our perception of life.",
    "Often times, we are limited by our pattern of thinking, how we perceive ideas and the world.",
    "What sets one man or woman apart from the other, is how he or she thinks.",
    "What sets man apart from other forms of life is our higher thinking and our higher consciousness.",
    "What if society had the Keys/ Qi / Chi or Energy in the form of thoughts, in order to assist in #unlocking the mind to become actively enlightened? Changing our patterns of thoughts, through the study and practical application of Philosophy, Psychology, Physics and History, for the understanding of the modern world at the micro and macro levels, how to stay on the right journey towards success and even more so, how to approach everyday life. To facilitate the liberation of ones mind for the journey of life, these #keys will help you in changing your pattern of thoughts towards your life's Consciousness, Enlightenment, Social Structure, Family, Friends, Self-Awareness and Beyond. It is my belief, that our greatest leaders throughout time and history, desired for us to achieve a higher reasoning; a higher thought pattern, to give us a higher mind, so that we may be never led into darkness again."]
